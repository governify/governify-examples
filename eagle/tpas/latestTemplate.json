Having more 1-point stories allow the developers to make fewer decisions at a time and get more information to reduce the uncertainties for other stories.\r\n\r\n**How?** It can be difficult to have 1-point stories at the beginning because learning should be taken into consideration when you pointing a story. If learning has to happen before implementing a story, then this story may be more than one point.\r\n\r\nHowever, as you are more experienced in the technology and you learn more about the code base, you should have more 1-point stories that are concrete enough to know the implementation strategy beforehand.\r\n\r\nWhen you start a new feature, you may have to deal with stories that are large and uncertain. You can consider creating small �spike� stories to quickly get more information to reduce the uncertainties.\r\n\r\nThe number presented is the percentage of 1-point stories in the backlog.

At the end of the iteration, all of the given tasks that were planned for that iteration should be completed and delivered to the customer. Any discrepancy in this shows an inaccuracy in assigning points to the stories in the planning phase.\r\n\r\n**How?** It is critical that as you gain experience with a project, programming language, and code base, that your (and your team�s) ability to properly assign work improves. Although this may be difficult in the first few iterations, your team should get significantly better at estimating how much work can be delivered to the customer at the end of an iteration. This is the goal of having Iteration Planning Meetings (to properly assign points for the next iteration), and Retrospectives (to reflect on how much work your team is able to complete in an iteration).\r\n\r\nThe number presented is the number of remaining points in the backlog.  Stories will be removed from the sum when they are `delivered`.
